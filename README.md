# Data_Analysis-on-IPL


I recently undertook an in-depth analysis of the Indian Premier League (IPL) from 2008 to 2020 using MS Excel. By leveraging advanced features like Power Pivot, Pivot Tables, and interactive Slicers, I transformed raw data into compelling visualizations, including pie charts and bar plots. These tools enabled seamless data manipulation and enhanced visualization, providing clear insights into team performances, player statistics, and match outcomes across different seasons. This powerful analysis not only highlights the IPL's evolution but also offers valuable perspectives for strategic planning and decision-making.
